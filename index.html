						<p>There are six types of higher education institution in Ukraine, each awarded a certain level of accreditation. Degree programs at bachelor’s level and above are offered by institutions with the highest level of accreditation, known as universities, academies and conservatories.<br><img src="img/stud.jpg" width="100%">

						Conservatories deal mainly in culture, the arts and music.Universities tend to be multi-disciplinary establishments, hosting a variety of specialist departments, though some are ‘branch’ or mono-disciplinary, specialist establishments. Academies, like mono-disciplinary universities, also concentrate on a specific branch of knowledge.<br>

						The categories covered by specialist institutions include: technical, medical, agrarian, pedagogical, technological (construction and transportation), economics (including finance, administration and entrepreneurship), culture (arts and design), health care and law. Look out for universities with a ‘National’ status – awarded for outstanding performance in research and scientific activity.<br>

						Undergraduate degrees at universities in Ukraine usually take four years to complete. Languages used for instruction include Russian, Ukrainian, English and French (for medical programs only). International applicants may need to take a language proficiency test, or attend the preparatory faculty for one academic year to study Russian and/or Ukrainian. Students studying in English or French do not need to attend the preparatory faculty, but can study the language as an independent course during their degree program. Make sure to check the language(s) your course will be taught in before you apply!<br>

						Six universities in Ukraine are featured in the QS World University Rankings® 2016-2017, while a further eight are included in the QS University Rankings: EECA 2016. Read on for a quick overview of the top three.
